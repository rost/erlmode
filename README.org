* What is this?
  erlmode intends to replace the erlang-mode from OTP as a major-mode for
  editing Erlang code in Emacs that Just Works(tm).

  It should have sane defaults and require as little setup as possible. The
  idea is to use pure elisp for as many features as possible, instead of
  relying on external tools like ctags or a running Erlang VM.

  For things like debugging, compiling, running tests, etc. you do however need
  a running node, porting over the required functionality from Distel needed
  for these things are in the works.

* Install
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/erlmode-root/")
  (require 'erlmode-start)

* What it gives you
  - You should not have to specify an erlang-root-dir
  - You will have automagic 'tags' support, using M-. and M-, you will be able
    to jump to definitions of various Erlang language constructs, including:
    - functions (local, external, imported, etc.)
    - records
    - macros
    - header files
    - modules
  - Some indentation fixes and breakages for nicely aligning various parens and
    commas, etc.
  - Probably other things I'm forgetting now.

* Bindings
  M-.      -- jump to source
  M-,      -- jump back from source
  C-c C-f  -- ido file-listing of project modules

* What's planned
  Apart from having a huge todo list the things closest in the future is an
  eldoc version for Erlang code and porting over auto-complete-distel and
  hippie-expand-distel to use erlmode code for completion.
  
** Erlang VM runtime interaction
   Elisp parts of Distel that is needed for communicating with an Erlang node
   will be moved over into erlmode to provide a way of communicating with a node
   that will run.

* Notes
  To provide the code jumping features this mode tries to guess a project root
  and index relevant files. One codebase at work I'm trying this out on
  contains ~3800 .erl and .hrl files, indexing that takes around 1.4s with the
  SSD I'm running. If you're running an old mechanical disk it should take more
  time, together with indexing the OTP modules it might take several
  seconds. This beats having to (successfully) compile your code base to be
  able to use debug info from beam files.

  If this indexing time seems to be an issue I'll probably move the incremental
  indexing plans up the todo list.

  Yes, this is not the academic way of doing things. The parsing is ad-hoc and
  ugly and simple guesses most of the time, but most things seem to work out of
  the box. Until I get around to finishing the semantic wisent parser for
  Erlang code this is the way it will work.

* Bugs?
  Most likely lots of them.
